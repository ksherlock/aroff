# AROFF

GNO/ME includes an `aroff` utility to display AppleWorks GS word processor documents. (Early version of GNO/ME used AWGS for some manual pages, believe it or not),  GNO/ME also includes an `aw30` utility to display AppleWorks word processor documents.  Both use hard-coded control codes for bold formatting.  Why not unify them, switch over to termcap for styling, maybe a fix a few bugs, improve the rendering...
